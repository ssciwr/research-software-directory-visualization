They are an extention of the Rotamerically Induced Perturbation (RIP) MD approach, which employs perturbation of side-chain torsional motion for initiating large-scale protein movement. RIP enables protein flexibility that normally occurs on the microsecond or longer time scale (for example, distortion of secondary and tertiary structure) to be explored. In Langevin-RIP (L-RIP) approach perturbation is applied to the side chains of the binding site residues, but the original RIP procedure is modified by using a Langevin thermostat in the simulations instead of the original constant-energy conditions. This ensures that the average protein temperature is preserved during the MD simulations. Additionally, the friction term enables the elements of the protein structure with fast relaxation times to equilibrate within each perturbation pulse. This makes it possible to increase the number of pulses and, thus, enhance sampling of slow conformational variations. In RIPlig, the perturbation procedure is applied not to each protein residue, but to an artificial molecule placed in the binding pocket with repetitions starting with different positions of the molecule, which enables flexible regions of the binding site to be identified in a small number of MD simulations of several picoseconds duration.\n      ",

For example, do you want to work together with people in a community to map their experience and perception of risk in their neighbourhood in a paper-based format, but still be able to quickly analyse the results digitally? Then, the Sketch&nbsp;Map Tool is exactly what you need!\n      ",

SYCAMORE is not intended to substitute for expert simulation and modeling software packages, but might interact with those. It is rather intended to support and guide system biologists when doing computational research. One important function of SYCAMORE is to allow you to build a draft model of your system of interest in such a way that kinetic expressions and parameters are as close to reality as possible. We want to emphasize that the resulting model still has a draft character and should not be taken as \"the final model\". However, setting up your model in such a way that parameters etc. are as close to reality as possible on the basis of literature data and computational parameter estimation methods should faciliate any parameter fitting methods that you want to employ later on.\n      ",

The TRAPP webserver, and the downloadable command line version, is intended to aid the discovery of ligands that bind in transient subpockets in proteins. The TRAPP webserver offers a range of tools to explore binding site motions ranging from local side chain fluctuations to global backbone motions; analysis of the binding site dynamics in simulated protein motion trajectories or trajectories provided by the user; a tool for tracking, analysis and visualization of protein cavity dynamics in an ensemble of protein structures or in protein trajectories; detection of transient pockets and subpockets that may appear due to protein motion; combined analysis of the protein sequence conservation and the variations of the physicochemical properties of a binding pocket; assessment of the binding pocket druggability and its variation in simulated trajectories and visualization of the pocket regions that favorably contribute to the pocket druggability. TRAPP is not designed to identify all of a protein's binding pockets, but rather to trace changes in the spatial and physicochemical properties of a specified pocket in a protein that may arise due to the protein's flexibility.\n      ",

In parallel, a given velocity profile of the background plasma is considered. After a certain time, due to the scattering of this plasma, an equilibrium is established between the particles moving forward and backward.
